\usepackage{natbib}

% use the natbib citations commands, always in starred version (all authors):
% - \citet*{...} to cite a reference as a word of the sentence
% - \citep*{...} to cite a reference as a parenthetical remark
%
% Examples:
% - "On the other hand, \citet*{...} have shown that..."
%   ('has shown' for a single-author paper, it reads as if we refer to the
%   authors).
% - "This is used in MLF~\citep*{...}, which accepts this example."

\usepackage{url}
% loading 'url' here ensures that URLs are broken into several lines
% in the bibliography (see natbib documentation).

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\citestyle{acmauthoryear}   %% For author/year citations
