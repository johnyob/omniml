Computing the syntactic dependencies $\cprec$ is in $O(n \log n)$ where $n$
is the size of the constraint (not just of suspended constraints).  However,
it is not stable by defaulting. Indeed, this may remove (and add) some
syntactic dependencies, which requires the re-computation of $\prec$.
Incremental computation of dependencies with both edge removal and insertion
may be needed. In any case, experimentation will be needed to
understand whether this is a critical issue.
