  abstract     = {Strongly typed languages with records may have inclusion
                  rules so that records with more fields can be used instead
                  of records with less fields. But these rules lead to a
                  global treatment of record types as a special case. We
                  solve this problem by giving an ordinary status to records
                  without any ad hoc assertions, replacing inclusion rules
                  by extra information in record types. With this encoding
                  ML naturally extends its polymorphism to records but any
                  other host language will also transmit its power.},

                  language with function variables and λ-abstractions within
                  terms makes a good meta-programming language, especially
                  when an object-language contains notions of bound
                  variables and scope. The λProlog logic programming
                  language and the related Elf and Isabelle systems provide
                  meta-programs with both function variables and
                  λ-abstractions by containing implementations of higher
                  order unification. This paper presents a logic programming
                  language, called Lλ, that also contains both function
                  variables and λ-abstractions, although certain
                  restrictions are placed on occurrences of function
                  variables. As a result of these restrictions, an
                  implementation of Lλdoes not need to implement full
                  higher-order unification. Instead, an extension to
                  first-order unification that respects bound variable names
                  and scopes is all that is required. Such unification
                  problems are shown to be decidable and to possess most
                  general unifiers when unifiers exist. A unification
                  algorithm and logic programming interpreter are described
                  and proved correct. Several examples of using Lλ as a
                  meta-programming language are presented.},

                  our proposal, the introduction of polymorphic types is
                  fully explicit, that is, both introduction points and
                  exact polymorphic types are to be specified.  However, the
                  elimination of polymorphic types is semi-implicit: only
                  elimination points are to be specified as polymorphic
                  types themselves are inferred.  This extension is
                  particularly useful in Objective ML where polymorphism
                  replaces subtyping.  },

                  checking, which checks that a program satisfies a known
                  type, and type synthesis, which determines a type from the
                  program. Using checking enables bidirectional typing to
                  support features for which inference is undecidable; using
                  synthesis enables bidirectional typing to avoid the large
                  annotation burden of explicitly typed languages. In
                  addition, bidirectional typing improves error locality. We
                  highlight the design principles that underlie
                  bidirectional type systems, survey the development of
                  bidirectional typing from the prehistoric period before

                  that type. The decidability of these problems has been
                  settled for restrictions and extensions of F and related
                  systems and complexity lower-bounds have been determined
                  for typability in F, but this report is the first to
                  resolve whether these problems are decidable for System
                  F. This report proves that type checking in F is
                  undecidable, by a reduction from semi-unification, and
                  that typability in F is undecidable, by a reduction from
                  type checking. Because there is an easy reduction from
                  typability to type checking, the two problems are
                  equivalent. The reduction from type checking to typability
                  uses a novel method of constructing lambda terms that
                  simulate arbitrarily chosen type environments. All of the
                  results also hold for the λI-calculus.}

  abstract     = {The Milner Calculus is the typed λ-calculus underlying the
                  type system for the programming language ML [Har86] and
                  several other strongly typed polymorphic functional
                  languages such as Miranda [Tur86] and SPS [Wan84]. Mycroft
                  [Myc84] extended the problematical typing rule for
                  recursive definitions and proved that the resulting
                  calculus, termed Milner-Mycroft Calculus here, is sound
                  with respect to Milner's [Mil78] semantics and that it
                  preserves the principal typing property [DM82] of the
                  Milner Calculus. The extension is of practical
                  significance in typed logic programming languages [MO84]
                  and, more generally, in any language with (mutually)
                  recursive definitions.Mycroft didn't solve the
                  decidability problem for typings in this calculus,
                  though. This was an open problem independently raised also
                  by Meertens [Mee83]. The decidability question was
                  answered in the affirmative just recently by Kfoury et
                  al. in [KTU88]. We show that the type inference problems
                  in the Milner and the Milner-Mycroft Calculi can be
                  reduced to solving equations and inequations between
                  first-order terms, a problem we have termed
                  semi-unification. We show that semi-unification problems
                  have most general solutions in analogy to unification
                  problems — which translates into principal typing
                  properties for the underlying calculi. In contrast to the
                  (essentially) nonconstructive methods of [KTU88] we
                  present functional specifications, which we prove
                  partially correct, for computing the most general solution
                  of semi-unification problems, and we devise a concrete
                  nondeterministic algorithm on a graph-theoretic
                  representation for computing these most general
                  solutions. Finally, we point out some erroneous statements
                  about the efficiency of polymorphic type checking that
                  have persisted throughout the literature including an
                  incorrect claim, submitted by ourselves, of polynomial
                  time type checking in the Milner-Mycroft Calculus.},

  abstract     = { Many type systems for records have been proposed. For
                  most of them, the types cannot be described as the terms
                  of an algebra. In this case, type checking, or type
                  inference in the case of first order type systems, cannot
                  be derived from existing algorithms. We define record
                  terms as the terms of an equational algebra. We prove
                  decidability of the unification problem for records terms
                  by showing that its equational theory is syntactic. We
                  derive a complete algorithm and prove its termination. We
                  define a notion of canonical terms and approximations of
                  record terms by canonical terms, and show that
                  approximations commute with unification. We also study
                  generic record terms, which extend record terms to model a
                  form of sharing between terms. We prove the syntacticness
                  of the equational theory of generic record terms and the
                  termination of the corresponding unification algorithm.  },

  abstractNote = {Through the use of conditional compilation and related
                  tools, many software projects can be used to generate a
                  huge number of related programs. The problem of typing
                  such variational software is difficult. The brute-force
                  strategy of generating all variants and typing each one
                  individually is: (1) usually infeasible for efficiency
                  reasons and (2) produces results that do not map well to
                  the underlying variational program. Recent research has
                  focused mainly on efficiency and addressed only the
                  problem of type checking. In this work we tackle the more
                  general problem of variational type inference and
                  introduce variational types to represent the result of
                  typing a variational program. We introduce the variational
                  lambda calculus (VLC) as a formal foundation for research
                  on typing variational programs. We define a type system
                  for VLC in which VLC expressions are mapped to
                  correspondingly variational types. We show that the type
                  system is correct by proving that the typing of
                  expressions is preserved over the process of variation
                  elimination, which eventually results in a plain lambda
                  calculus expression and its corresponding type. We
                  identify a set of equivalence rules for variational types
                  and prove that the type unification problem modulo these
                  equivalence rules is unitary and decidable; we also
                  present a sound and complete unification algorithm. Based
                  on the unification algorithm, the variational type
                  inference algorithm is an extension of algorithm W . We
                  show that it is sound and complete and computes principal
                  types. We also consider the extension of VLC with sum
                  types, a necessary feature for supporting variational data
                  types, and demonstrate that the previous theoretical
                  results also hold under this extension. Finally, we
                  characterize the complexity of variational type inference
                  and demonstrate the efficiency gains over the brute-force
                  strategy.},

  abstractNote = {At the heart of the Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) type system
                  lies the abstraction rule which derives a function type
                  for a lambda expression. In this rule, the type of the
                  parameter can be “guessed”, and can be any type that fits
                  the derivation. The beauty of the HM system is that there
                  always exists a most general type that encompasses all
                  possible derivations – Algorithm W is used to infer these
                  most general types in practice. Unfortunately, this
                  property is also the bane of the HM type rules. Many
                  languages extend HM typing with additional features which
                  often require complex side conditions to the type rules to
                  maintain principal types. For example, various type
                  systems for impredicative type inference, like HMF,
                  FreezeML, or Boxy types, require let-bindings to always
                  assign most general types. Such a restriction is difficult
                  to specify as a logical deduction rule though, as it
                  ranges over all possible derivations. Despite these
                  complications, the actual implementations of various type
                  inference algorithms are usually straightforward
                  extensions of algorithm W, and from an implementation
                  perspective, much of the complexity of various type system
                  extensions, like boxes or polymorphic weights, is in some
                  sense artificial. In this article we rephrase the HM type
                  rules as _type inference under a prefix_, called HMQ. HMQ
                  is sound and complete with respect to the HM type rules,
                  but always derives principal types that correspond to the
                  types inferred by algorithm W. The HMQ type rules are
                  close to the clarity of the declarative HM type rules, but
                  also specific enough to “read off” an inference algorithm,
                  and can form an excellent basis to describe type system
                  extensions in practice. We show in particular how to
                  describe the FreezeML and HMF systems in terms of
                  inference under a prefix, and how we no longer require
                  complex side conditions. We also show a novel
                  formalization of static overloading in HMQ as implemented
                  in Koka language.},

  abstract     = {ML is remarkable in providing statically typed
                  polymorphism without the programmer ever having to write
                  any type annotations. The cost of this parsimony is that
                  the programmer is limited to a form of polymorphism in
                  which quantifiers can occur only at the outermost level of
                  a type and type variables can be instantiated only with
                  monomorphic types.  Type inference for unrestricted System
                  F-style polymorphism is undecidable in
                  general. Nevertheless, the literature abounds with a range
                  of proposals to bridge the gap between ML and System F.
                  We put forth a new proposal, FreezeML, a conservative
                  extension of ML with two new features. First, let- and
                  lambda-binders may be annotated with arbitrary System F
                  types. Second, variable occurrences may be frozen,
                  explicitly disabling instantiation. FreezeML is equipped
                  with type-preserving translations back and forth between
                  System F and admits a type inference algorithm, an
                  extension of algorithm W, that is sound and complete and
                  which yields principal types.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The language MLF is a proposal for a new type system that
                  supersedes both ML and System F, allows for efficient,
                  predictable, and complete type inference for partially
                  annotated terms.  In this work, we revisit the definition
                  of MLF, following a more progressive approach and focusing
                  on the design-space and expressiveness.  We introduce a
                  Curry-style version iMLF of MLF and provide an
                  interpretation of iMLF types as instantiation-closed sets
                  of System-F types, from which we derive the definition of
                  type instance in iMLF.  We give equivalent syntactic
                  definition of the type-instance, presented as a set of
                  inference rules.  We also show an encoding of iMLF into
                  the closure of Curry-style System F by let-expansion.  We
                  derive the Church-style version eMLF by refining types of
                  iMLF so as to distinguish between given and inferred
                  polymorphism.  We show an embedding of ML in eMLF and a
                  straightforward encoding of System F into eMLF.}

abstract = {Bidirectional typechecking, in which terms either synthesize a type or are checked against a known type, has become popular for its scalability (unlike Damas-Milner type inference, bidirectional typing remains decidable even for very expressive type systems), its error reporting, and its relative ease of implementation. Following design principles from proof theory, bidirectional typing can be applied to many type constructs. The principles underlying a bidirectional approach to polymorphism, however, are less obvious. We give a declarative, bidirectional account of higher-rank polymorphism, grounded in proof theory; this calculus enjoys many properties such as eta-reduction and predictability of annotations. We give an algorithm for implementing the declarative system; our algorithm is remarkably simple and well-behaved, despite being both sound and complete.},

  abstract     = {Bidirectional typing is a simple, lightweight approach to
                  type inference that propagates known type information
                  during typing, and can scale up to many different type
                  systems and features.  It typically only requires a
                  reasonable amount of annotations and eliminates the need
                  for many obvious annotations. Nonetheless the power of
                  inference is still limited, and complications arise in the
                  presence of more complex features.  In this paper we
                  present a generalization of bidirectional typing called
                  contextual typing. In contextual typing not only known
                  type information is propagated during typing, but also
                  other known information about the surrounding context of a
                  term. This information can be of various forms, such as
                  other terms or record labels.  Due to this richer notion
                  of contextual information, less annotations are needed,
                  while the approach remains lightweight and scalable. For
                  type systems with subtyping, contextual typing subsumption
                  is also more expressive than subsumption with
                  bidirectional typing, since partially known contextual
                  information can be exploited.  To aid specifying type
                  systems with contextual typing, we introduce Quantitative
                  Type Assignment Systems (QTASs). A QTAS quantifies the
                  amount of type information that a term needs in order to
                  type check using counters. Thus, a counter in a QTAS
                  generalizes modes in traditional bidirectional typing,
                  which can only model an all (checking mode) or nothing
                  (inference mode) approach.  QTASs enable precise
                  guidelines for annotatability of contextual type systems
                  formalized as a theorem.  We illustrate contextual typing
                  first on a simply typed lambda calculus, and then on a
                  richer calculus with subtyping, intersection types,
                  records and overloading. All the metatheory is formalized
                  in the Agda theorem prover.},
